<h1>Using Nessus Essentials to Secure Your Home Network: Vulnerability Management</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials">Nessus Essentials</a> (formerly Nessus Home) by <a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/vulnerability-management">Tenable</a>, is a free security vulnerability scanning tool to discover common vulnerabilities on your home/non-enterprise network. Nessus Essentials is an effective tool to track existing vulnerabilities on your network and patch them to reduce the risk of exploitation.</p>
<p>Nessus Essentials does not have any strict hardware requirements. However, before you begin setting up Nessus, please note the following regarding the software:</p>

<h3>Performing your first network scan</h3>
<p>Before you begin searching for vulnerabilities on your devices, you will need to discover the existing hosts on the network. You will need to determine the subnet(s) your private network uses. This can be done using the command line if you have a single subnet, or by logging into your gateway and checking the local IP networks.</p>
<p>Please reference this great video tutorial on IP addresses and subnets by Zach Gollwitzer if needed:</p>

<br><br>
<p>Once you have your subnet addresses, log into your Nessus Essentials portal. You will be greeted with an empty folder where scans can be created and run.</p>
<p>First, create a Host Discovery scan to discover all the hosts on the network:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a New Scan in Nessus.</li>
  </p>
  <p align="center">

  </picture>
  <br>
  <em>New Scan option on the Nessus home page.</em>
</p>
  <li>Select Host Discovery from the list of scans.</li>
  <li>Give the scan a name and provide the subnet of your network, add commas between subnets if needed. Leave all other fields as default.</li>
  </p>
  <p align="center">

  </picture>
</p>
  <li>Save the new scan and select the launch option (▶) to run the scan.</li>
  <li>Wait for the scan to complete and the running icon to disappear. There’s an option to pause or stop the scan while in progress if needed.</li>
  </p>
  <p align="center">

  <br>
  <em>Running icon, with options to pause and stop.</em>
</p>
</ol>
<p>Once the Host Discovery scan is complete, you will receive a list of devices like the screenshot below:</p>

</p>
<p>You now have a list of all the devices connected to your network. The host discovery scan result will be available to reference in your folder to track any new connections made to your network and have more effective vulnerability management in place.</p>
<h4>What is Vulnerability Management?</h4>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>Vulnerability management is the practice of continuously assessing your company’s assets to keep an accurate list of existing devices. Once a list of assets is created, we identify vulnerabilities with tools like Nessus Essentials and remediate them to an acceptable level of risk. Remediation is then verified with additional scans. The accepted level of risk is recorded for the existing state of the network and is then referenced as a baseline for future scans. This practice is repeated from time to discover new devices and any new vulnerabilities that are reassessed. New vulnerabilities are evaluated and remediated to bring the network back to an accepted level of risk.</p>

<h3>Basic Network Scan for Vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>You can now use the list of devices found from the Host Discovery scan to perform a basic non-credentialed scan to discover immediate vulnerabilities on the network. A non-credentialed scan will look for vulnerabilities on your devices without trusted access to the machines to have a deeper look. This scan shows immediate vulnerabilities that can be seen from the perspective of an outside attacker on your network.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to perform a Basic Network Scan on your list of hosts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select all hosts from the Host Discovery Scan using the ticker box in the top left corner of the list.</li>
  <li>Use the More option and select Create Scan.</li>
  <li>From the list of scans, select Basic Network Scan under Vulnerabilities. The template will automatically fill the list of IP addresses that were selected previously. Give the scan a name and leave everything else as default.</li>
  <li>Once the scan is created, press the launch option (▶) as done with the Host Discovery scan and wait for it to complete.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here you will see a list of vulnerabilities rated by info/low to critical. It is up to you as the user to view the description of each vulnerability to see if it is a risk you are willing to accept or mitigate. All vulnerabilities cannot be removed however it is effective to create a baseline of vulnerabilities on the network and perform scans over time to check for new vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>In this example we have 5 high and 17 medium severity vulnerabilities. If we check the first device we find the following vulnerability:</p>
<p>Once a vulnerability is reviewed, we can remediate the issue using the suggestions provided by Nessus or any other available methods. To remediate this example, authentication is enabled to access the share drive from the share’s admin page:</p>
<p>It is good practice to scan your network on a fixed period to check for unnecessary vulnerabilities to reduce the risk of exploitation. The reporting option in the corner of the page can be used to save the results in your preferred format for future reference of your baseline.</p>

<h3>Performing a credentialed scan for additional vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>With a credentialed scan, you can search for vulnerabilities from the perspective of a trusted user by logging into the device. This allows for additional vulnerabilities to be identified that can pose a risk to your network.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to perform a Basic Credentialed Scan on a single host:</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Having a vulnerability management program with a single tool like Nessus Essentials can be very effective in reducing the risk created from vulnerabilities you are made aware of.
With the steps in this guide, you can use Nessus Essentials to:</p>
