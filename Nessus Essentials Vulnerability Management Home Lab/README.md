<h1>Using Nessus Essentials to Secure Your Home Network: Vulnerability Management</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials">Nessus Essentials</a> (formerly Nessus Home) by <a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/vulnerability-management">Tenable</a>, is a free security vulnerability scanning tool to discover common vulnerabilities on your home/non-enterprise network. Nessus Essentials is an effective tool to track existing vulnerabilities on your network and patch them to reduce the risk of exploitation.</p>
<p>Nessus Essentials does not have any strict hardware requirements. However, before you begin setting up Nessus, please note the following regarding the software:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Can be installed on on <b>Windows</b>, <b>Mac</b>, and <b>Linux</b>.</li>
  <li>Nessus utilizes a web user interface, supported on <b>Mozilla Firefox</b>, <b>Google Chrome</b>, <b>Edge</b> and <b>Safari</b>.</li>
  <li>Nessus Essentials is limited to scanning up to <b>16 IP addresses</b> at a time. Certain features are also locked behind the Nessus Professional plan.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to install Nessus Essentials?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Register an account to receive your activation code to Nessus Essentials <a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials">here</a>.</li>
  <li>You will receive an email with your key that will also provide a link to a download page for Nessus, navigate to the download page and download the first available option.</li>
  <li>Select the installer for your Operating System from the list:</li>
  <li>Launch the installer, the installation will initialize in your default browser (5–10 minutes).</li>
  <li>Once initialized, select Nessus Essentials from the list of products to install and continue. Skip the “Get Activation Code” page and enter your code on the Registration page.</li>
  <li>Allow 10–20 minutes for Nessus Essentials to complete installing. Record the URL to return to the web interface later (<a href="https://localhost:8834">https://localhost:8834</a>).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Performing your first network scan</h3>
<p>Before you begin searching for vulnerabilities on your devices, you will need to discover the existing hosts on the network. You will need to find out the subnet(s) your private network uses. This can be done using command line, if you have a single subnet, or by logging into your gateway and checking the local IP networks.</p>
<p>Please reference this great video tutorial on IP addresses and subnets by Zach Gollwitzer if needed:</p>

<br><br>
<p>Once you have your subnet addresses, log into your Nessus Essentials portal. You will be greeted to an empty folder where scans can be created and ran.</p>
<p>First, create a Host Discovery scan to discover all the hosts on the network:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a New Scan in Nessus.</li>
  <li>Select Host Discovery from the list of scans.</li>
  <li>Give the scan a name and provide the subnet of your network, add commas between subnets if needed. Leave all other fields as default.</li>
  <li>Save the new scan and select the launch option (▶) to run the scan.</li>
  <li>Wait for the scan to complete and the running icon to disappear. There’s an option to pause or stop the scan while in progress if needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the Host Discovery scan is complete, you will receive a list of devices like the screenshot below:</p>
<p>You now have a list of all the devices connected to your network. The host discovery scan result will be available to reference in your folder to track any new connections made to your network and have more effective vulnerability management in place.</p>
<h4>What is Vulnerability Management?</h4>
<p>Vulnerability management is the practice of continuously assessing your company’s assets to keep an accurate list of existing devices. Once a list of assets is created, we identify vulnerabilities with tools like Nessus Essentials and remediate them to an acceptable level of risk. Remediation is then verified with additional scans. The accepted level of risk is recorded for the existing state of the network and is then referenced as a baseline for future scans. This practice is repeated from time to discover new devices and any new vulnerabilities which are reassessed. New vulnerabilities are evaluated and remediated to bring the network back to an accepted level of risk.</p>

<h3>Basic Network Scan for Vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>You can now use the list of devices found from the Host Discovery scan to perform a basic non-credentialed scan to discover immediate vulnerabilities on the network. A non-credentialed scan will look for vulnerabilities on your devices without trusted access into the machines to have a deeper look. This scan shows immediate vulnerabilities that can be seen from the perspective of an outside attacker on your network.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to perform a Basic Network Scan on your list of hosts:</p>


<h3>Performing a credentialed scan for additional vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>With a credentialed scan, you are able to search for vulnerabilities from the perspective of a trusted user by logging into the device. This allows for additional vulnerabilities to be identified that can pose a risk to your network.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to perform a Basic Credentialed Scan on a single host:</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Having a vulnerability management program with a single tool like Nessus Essentials can be very effective in reducing the risk created from vulnerabilities you are made aware of.
